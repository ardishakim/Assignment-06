## Overview

This project focuses on digital image processing and transfer learning techniques to improve image quality and perform multi-class classification using deep learning-based computer vision models. The implementation includes methods like Pooling, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), and popular pre-trained models such as ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT).

## Project Description

The project can be divided into two main components:

1. **Digital Image Processing for Image Quality Enhancement:**

   - **Pooling:** This technique involves downsampling an image by selecting a representative pixel from a group of neighboring pixels. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of the image while preserving its essential features.

   - **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):** CLAHE enhances the contrast of an image by improving the distribution of pixel intensity values. It adapts the local contrast, making it suitable for various lighting conditions.

2. **Transfer Learning for Multi-Class Classification:**

   - **Deep Learning-based Models:** We utilize popular deep learning architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) as pre-trained models for the multi-class classification task.
